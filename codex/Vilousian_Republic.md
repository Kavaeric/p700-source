The **Imperial Republic of Vilous** (commonly referred to as the
**Vilousian Republic** or **Vilous Republic**) is a confederation founded in 12M 694 by the
Vilousian nations [Shigu Kingdom](Shigu_Kingdom.html) and the
[Ring Collective](Ring_Collective.html). The nation occupies a region in forthward
[Juxta Sagittaria](Juxta_Sagittaria), sharing a loose border with the
[Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html). It is the newest nation in the Galaxy, and is regarded
as the primary representative nation of [eltus](Eltus.html) civilisation.

## Etymology
The Vilous Republic is named after the star [Vilous](Vilous.html), which [Tal](Tal.html) orbits;
Vilous culture has strong ties to stars for ethnicity as opposed to planets in Terran culture.

The [English](English.html) name "Vilous" originates from the
[Vilousian Surveys](Vilousian_Surveys.html) from 663 to 689, although origins regarding specific
personnel or even interview subjects remain unclear. The roots of the original [Sekir](Sekir.html)
word *Híraus* are even more obscure, with no prevailing theories as to its original meaning.

## History
Much discussion for a peacekeeping alliance or even unified state on [Tal](Tal.html) had been
discussed even before [contact](Vilousian_contact.html) with the
[Terrans](Terran_Federation.html) and [Ikamo](Ikamo_Federation.html), with desire for peace
following the [Great Tal War](Great_Tal_War.html), from 619 to 641, with social justice movements
supporting the idea, especially in [Gold Ring](Gold_Ring.html). However, much wartime rivalry still
persisted, even during the Vilousian Surveys, meaning such plans never gained much foothold.

Contact and introduction into wider galactic society, however, renewed interest in unifying the
eltus people: The individual city-states and kingdoms of Tal would have little voice against the
more unified ones of the Terrans and Ikamo. In 694, both the [Shigu Kingdom](Shigu_Kingdom.html) and
[Ring Collective](Ring_Collective.html) signed the [Cooperation Pact](Cooperation_Pact.html),
founding the Vilousian Republic.

The importance of the Vilousian Republic unification began to be highlighted with the start of the
[Vilousian War](Vilousian_War_Of_712.html), allowing the two member states to better coordinate
military operations against [Shigu Restorationists](Shigu_Restorationists.html) and
[Gold Ring Purists](Gold_Ring_Purists.html).

In 715, the political resources of the Vilousian Republic shifted to Gold Ring after the fall of
[Fort Lon Sodd](Fort_Lon_Sodd.html).
