**Juxta Sagittaria** (**The Orion Spur**, or **Sagittaria** for short) is a section of the
Sagittarius arm of the Galaxy that lies approximately 265 exametres (28 kly) from the galactic core
and is inhabited by all known forms of life, including all sapient populations.

## Galactic location
Juxta Sagittaria branches off from the main Sagittarius arm around 210 exametres forth and continues
down some 150 exametres trail. It is separated from the main arm by the Orion Gap to the medi, and
the Perseus Gap to the nigh, both of which are approximately 10 exametres wide.

## Exploration
Less than half of a percent of the stars in the region have been catalogued and surveyed, and even
fewer with any permanent population. Although a sufficiently powered
[quantum drive](Quantum_Drive.html) can theoretically cross the diameter in a little over two
months, exploration of space is limited through the need to refuel, as well as uncharted regions of
[hyperspace](Hyperspace.html) littered with [antimatter](Antimatter.html) which may damage or even
destroy a spacecraft on contact. [Warp drives](Warp_Drive.html) bypass hyperspace entirely, but are
many orders of magnitude slower.
