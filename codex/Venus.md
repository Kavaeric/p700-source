**Venus** (**Sol c**, or **Sol-II**) is the second planet from [Sol](Sol), a neighbour planet to
[Earth](Earth), and an economically important world in the [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation).

Venus is sometimes colloquially referred to as "Earth's twin" based on its similar mass and radius,
however, its crushing pressures, acidic atmosphere, and hostile surface heat prohibit any sort of
surface exploration. Hence, any habitation of Venus is made in the atmosphere, typically on board
[aerostat habitats](Aerostat_habitat) or on space stations.

## Geography
Venus' surface is a near-homogeneous desert landscape, with near-continuous volcanic activity. Venus,
however, does not appear to harbour tectonic plate activity; as such the crust is estimated to be
up to 500 million years old, compared to an Earth average of 100 million years. "Recycling" periods
occur every several hundred million years, where the entirety of the crust in its entirety is
replaced over the course of about a hundred million years.

## Atmosphere
Venus' extremely hostile atmosphere is perhaps its most famous aspect. Its atmospheric pressure
is over 90 times that of Earth's, and averages a steady temperature high enough to melt lead on its
surface, caused by a runaway greenhouse effect.

The Venusian atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, and likely
the cause of high Venusian temperatures. The atmosphere is a host to a considerable amount of
sulphur dioxide, which form a thick cloud layer obscuring the totality of the planet's surface. A
common myth is that it "rains" acid on Venus; although sulphuric acid is present in large quantities
on Venus, any sulphuric acid rain would evaporate long before hitting the ground due to the high
surface temperature.

### Resources
Venus's carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and proximity to Earth make it a lucrative mining world for
[carbon](Carbon), which is in turn used for a variety of carbon-based materials, including
various superalloys and [nanomaterials](Nanomaterial).

Although Venus' surface is likely rich in various metals, the harsh atmospheric conditions make
any sort of surface mining extremely difficult and uncompetitive.

## Habitation
Prior to the [First Exchange](First_Exchange), settlement in orbit around or in the atmosphere
of Venus was limited as habitation of Venus would have only been done for scientific research
purposes. The development and widespread adoption of carbon-based materials, however, has facilitated
explosive population growth on Venus.

Much of the Venusian population live on board aerostat habitats suspended in the Venusian atmosphere,
with some living in orbiting space stations instead, and some even living on the surface of Venus,
within the atmosphere.
