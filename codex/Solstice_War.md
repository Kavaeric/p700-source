The **Solstice War** (the **Chorale War**, or the **Terran Civil War**) was a
[Terran](Terran_Federation.html) conflict that lasted from 12E 368 to 12E 507. The war followed the
protests of political corruption in the [Terran Union](Terran_Union.html) parliament, and ultimately
ended with its dissolution, with Terran space fracturing into multiple warring factions for well
over a century, until the capture of [Geneva](Geneva.html) in 507 and the subsequent formation of
the modern [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html).

## Background
First contact and the following [First Exchange](First_Exchange.html) with the
[Ikamo](Ikamo_Federation.html) led to the successful development of the
[quantum drive](Quantum_drive.html), a [faster-than-light](Faster-than-light_travel.html)
transportation system that allowed spacecraft to travel much faster than those equipped with an
older [warp drive](Warp_drive.html) system. The discovery of abundant [antimatter](Antimatter.html)
in [hyperspace](Hyperspace.html) also sparked a metaphorical gold rush from Terran corporations,
backed by the then-Terran government, the [Terran Union](Terran_Union.html).

Private corporations quickly began aggressively pushing development of hyperspace travel and
[antimatter trawling](Antimatter.html#trawling) technologies, while simultaneously receiving
financial incentives from the Terran Union for their continued expansion into space and development
of antimatter trawling and quantum drive technology.

Over time the Terran Union became highly dependent on trawling corporations, allowing these
companies to expand their enterprises with little oversight. Most corporations also took advantage
of the scale of space to operate, with many relocating their businesses off [Earth](Earth.html) or
even outside the [Solar system](Solar_system.html) entirely, evading what little regulation was in
place already.

## Course of the war
By the 300s the wealth gap had widened considerably; exact statistics are still unclear, with most 
estimates placing the GINI coefficient of the Terran Union as a whole anywhere between 50% and 70%,
with some as high as 84%. Support for anti-establishment group rose rapidly in the populace, however
private lobbyists within the Terran Union's government and parliament suppressed much of the common
vote at the beheast of corporate lobbyists.

In September of 368, a wave of protests across the Terran Union sparked a violent response from
Terran authorities. While initially the unrest seemed to be under control, the situation gradually
deteriorated.

### Escalation to violence

Armed rebellion first appeared in the [Monkave](Monkave.html) and [Meridian](Meridian.html) systems
in 370, where protestors began arming themselves against increasingly violent police and paramilitary
peacekeeping forces. Monkave was captured in March 375, and declared itself independent of the
Terran Union, forming the [Monkave Revolutionary Enclave](Monkave_Revolutionary_Enclave.html), and
began supplying Revolutionaries elsewhere in the Union.

By 379 Revolutionary forces had begun sabotaging Union operations and supply lines, disrupting their
ability to control on other systems. As a result, Meridian and [Abergave](Abergave.html) were
captured in 383 and 385 respectively, despite fierce Terran Union resistance.

The situation gradually deteriorated. In November of 400, the Terran Union parliament building was
burned down in Geneva amidst wider fighting elsewhere on Earth. With fighting and rebellions taking
place across Terran space, the grip of the Terran Union began to weaken considerably.

While Terran pro-Establishment groups were significantly more powerful than Revolutionary forces, the
war had bogged down into a scattered stalemate due to the latter's use of guerilla warfare and raiding
tactics. Fringe extremist and terrorist groups further complicated matters, using the instability to
attempt to grasp more power. Fighting was distributed amongst ground assaults, including those on
Earth, as well as [aethership](Aethership.html) battles in space.

As the war progressed, the various fractured factions began to attempt to forge alliances, with
varying amounts of success. Many Establishment groups attempted to form alliances with other
likeminded factions, but rampant mistrust led to many of these ventures falling victim to infighting
or further fragmentation.

Revolutionary groups, however, fared better. In 463, a draft for what would become the
[Terran Accord](Terran_Accord.html) was written by an alliance of rebellious groups, establishing
their governance aboard a leviathan aethership, [Solidarity](Solidarity.html).

In 489, the alliance launched an invasion of Earth, as the endgame for establishing a new Terran
government. By 507, Geneva had been taken, and was incorporated as the capital for the newly-formed
[Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html).
