The **Nesse Piano Mystery** is an unsolved mystery concerning pianos with the brand name "Nesse"
scattered around various rural locations in [Juxta Sagittaria](Juxta_Sagittaria.html), with the
first discoveries of the pianos being made in 691, 693, and 694. A total of 6 pianos have been
found so far.

No real reasoning has been deduced from the discovery of the pianos, although some patterns have
been observed:
* The pianos are all of the same brand, Nesse, a musical instrument company that ran from 256 to 295.
* The pianos are of various models from the company.
* All pianos are in relatively remote and rural locations.
* All pianos show little sign of use, although some have aged considerably upon discovery.
