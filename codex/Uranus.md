**Uranus** (**Sol h**) is an ice giant of [Sol](Sol). It is known for its extreme axial tilt, where
the planet rotates at a striking 98 degree angle. The planet has a distinctly hazy, featureless
light blue appearance from orbit.

## History
Uranus' largest moon, [Oberon](Oberon), was first visited by Terrans in the beginning of the 100s
century, riding on the advent of [warp drive](Warp_drive) technology. A research outpost was settled
on Oberon in 111.

From then until the end of the 200s century, the planet enjoyed a long period of
sustained economic growth and development from its fairly accessible reserves of hydrogen and helium,
given the planet's relatively low gravity well compared to the other gas giants of Sol. So low is the
planet's gravity well, that it is in fact cheaper to perform a Hohmann transfer from Uranus than it
is from Saturn to Earth, despite being nearly twice the distance from Earth than Saturn.

The period of economic growth continued through the introduction of the [antimatter](Antimatter)
economy. Hydrogen continued to be in great demand as the secondary product in antimatter reactions,
and Uranus continued to maintain a strategic position in the [Sol system](Solar_system).

After the [Solstice War](Solstice_War), Uranus' growth slowed. Although its moons were candidates for
partial terraforming, [Saturn](Saturn) was chosen in lieu of Uranus for receiving the majority of
the [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation)'s resources for terraforming.

## Society
Uranians are typically a relatively reserved people, although not to the point of stoicism. Uranians
exhibit the usual range of Terran political outlook, with most backing
[Social Democratic](Social_Democratic_Party) policies, although there is unusually large support for
the [New Federalist Party](New_Federalist_Party) as well.

## Economy
Uranian mining is one of the oldest, most well-established economies in
[Juxta Sagittaria](Juxta_Sagittaria). The Uranian economy centres around the mining of gases from
the planet's atmosphere, notably hydrogen and isotopes of helium. Some of the terraformed landscape
on Oberon is used for agricultural purposes.
