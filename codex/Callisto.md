**Callisto** is one of the Galilean (major) moons of [Jupiter](Jupiter), the second largest moon of
Jupiter, as well as the fourth largest moon in the [Sol system](Solar_system), even being of similar
size to [Mercury](Mercury). Despite its orbital radius, Jupiter is massive enough to tidally lock
Callisto.

Callisto was the first moon of Jupiter to be colonised, being one of the larger bodies orbiting
Jupiter as well as being the only one of the Galilean moons to be well outside of Jupiter's radiation
belts. As a result, Callisto is still where the majority of Jovian activity is conducted.

## Geography
Callisto's outermost surface is a water ice sheet up to 170km in some locations, saturated with impact
craters. The reduced tidal forces exerted on Callisto mean there is no fracturing of the surface
ice sheet as seen on Europa. Underneath Callisto's ice sheet is a liquid water ocean rich in salt
and ammonia content.

## Society
Callistoans live a relatively quiet life amidst the usual bustle that envelops other moons and planets
in the Sol system. The highly decentralised Callistoan population typically supports the
[Anarchist Party](Anarchist_Party).

## Economy
With little reason to mine Jupiter for helium-3 or hydrogen, and with a lower density of light and
heavy elements, the Callistoan economy is comparatively small to that of other moons and planets.
Callisto's major export is water, which can be treated and shipped to other settlements elsewhere.

Callisto has a number of aquafarms in operation: Pockets of the underground ocean are sectioned
off, with waste heat from infrastructure pumped in, and with artificial sunlight installed. There,
these pockets can be used to maintain a limited aquatic biosphere of imported Terran ocean life,
namely algae, shrimp, and crustaceans, although some aquafarms have incorporated fishstocks into
their habitats as well. These aquafarm stocks serve as a tourist attraction within the Sol system,
as well as a luxury export.
