**Earth** (**Sol d**, or **Sol-III**) is the third planet from the type-G2V star [Sol](Sol).
It is the fifth largest planet body in the [Solar system](Solar_system), as well as the
densest. It has one natural satellite, [Luna](Luna), likely formed from a cataclysmic impact
with another planet early in the planet's history.

Earth is the homeworld of [Terrankind](Terrankind), as well as the capital and most populated
planet of the [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation). It is one of the three political capitals
in [Juxta Sagittaria](Juxta_Sagittaria), after [Ko](Ko) and [Tal](Tal).

## Biosphere
Life on Earth emerged some 3.8 billion years ago as single-cell life, but multicellular life is
approximately a billion years older. Early Terrene life would likely have emerged from oceans,
dependent on Earth's high moisture.

Between 200 and 65 million years ago in its past, Earth was dominated by enormous terrestrial
lizards, known as dinosaurs. A mass extinction event, likely an asteroid impact, led to their
demise. The extinction of the dinosaurs likely left mammalian organisms the opportunity to
diversify, leading to their modern dominance and the derivative evolution of Earth's sapient
species. 

## Geography
Earth is a temperate garden world with large reserves of water. Over two-thirds of the planet is
covered in ocean. On dry land, most is covered in thick forests.

Earth has a solid crust composed of mostly silicate rock material.

### Water
Some, with regards to its abundance of water, affectionately refer to Earth as "the blue planet", in
comparison to many other planets. The huge bodies of water give rise to enormous ocean currents that
cycle warm and cool water across the planet's latitudes, affecting planetary climate.

While abundant in water, 97.5% is saline, making it untenable for Terrans drink it without
filtration. Plentiful precipitation, however, allows sources of fresh water to be accessed.

Because of the abundance of water, Terran civilisation is very dependent on trade and transport
across bodies of water. Maritime culture is heavily ingrained in Terran culture as a result, much
of it having bled into present-day interstellar culture, mostly in terminology.

### Resources
Being a garden world, Earth is a favourable location for the production of food, both for crops and
livestock, however Terran legal tradition heavily regulates agriculture on the planet.

Mining grants access to other resources. Hydrocarbon fuels are prevelant due to the planet's
wetlands in the past, such as coal, natural gas and oil, although again, Terran legal tradition has
mostly banned the extraction and use of these resources. Other minerals present on the plane
include vast quantities of materials such as aluminium, copper, silicon, and thorium.

The planet's seawater can be mass desalinised as well to provide fresh water for export.

## Atmosphere
Earth's atmosphere is composed of roughly 80% nitrogen gas and 20% oxygen gas, the latter vital to
the survival of animal life on Earth. Precipitation varies between rain, sleet, and snow, as well
as volume depending on local climate conditions.

Ozone molecules are abundant approximately 20 to 30 kilometres above the surface of the Earth. The
layer proetects the surface of the Earth from otherwise harmful ultraviolet radiation. While ozone
is hazardous to most multicellular carbon life if inhaled, the layer is too high to warrant any real
hazard.

## Society
[Terran](Terran) civilisation first formed on Earth and is mostly saturated in areas with
milder climates, though advances in technology allowed many to live in harsher conditions on the
planet.

With its tremendous population and capital status, Earth is to be considered no less than one of the
most diverse worlds in Juxta Sagittaria. Its relative proximity to [Ikamo](Ikamo_Federation) space
has also granted it a considerable non-terran population as well.

As of 2717 the planet's population was was estimated at approximately 15.5 billion inhabitants, and
is expected to remain mostly stable.

## Hazards
Although not as extreme as the other planets in its system, Earth's weather can be dangerous due to
its unpredictability. Much of Earth's weather is driven by the massive amount of water present on
its surface, giving rise to colossal storm systems. Blizzards and storms are common in colder
regions of the planet; Other severe weather phenomena such as hail and tornadoes also occur on
Earth. 

### Tropical Cyclones
Most famously are Earth's tropical cyclones, massive rotating storms that form in Earth's large open
oceans with warm water. Storm strength varies depending on various environmental factors. At the
very centre of each storm is an area of low pressure, forming a "hole" in the storm system, known as
the eye.

Regions closer to the centre of a tropical cyclone receive more severe weather than regions towards
the edge. Weather within the eye is, in fact, extremely clear and calm; The border of the eye, known
as the eyewall, however, is where weather is most severe, with the most extreme wind speeds, air
flow, and precipitation.

Non-Terrenes are often the most vulnerable to Earth cyclones, as the eye often falsely misleads them
to believing the storm is over, moments before the intense weather of the eyewall returns.

### Geography
The planet's highly active tectonic plates regularly produce powerful earthquakes and active
volcanic activity, though relatively few are devastating. Most seismic activity is concentrated
around an area surrounding the Pacific Ocean, dubbed the Ring of Fire. Subsequently, about 75% of
Earth's volcanoes are concentrated within this region. Earthquakes occuring underwater can also
produce massive waves known as tsunamis, which can travel hundreds of kilometres before impacting
coastlines.

### Extraplanetary
In the scope of space, Earth's system harbours a considerably near
[asteroid field](Solar_Asteroid_Belt), although impacts are mitigated from its unusually large
moon and the gas giant [Jupiter](Jupiter).
