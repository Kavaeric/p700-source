The **First Exchange** was a series of communications and partnerships between
[Terran](Terran_Federation.html) and [Ikamo](Ikamo_Federation.html) civilisations. It is generally
defined as the period between first contact being made in 226, and first physical contact on board
[Gateway Prime](Gateway_Prime.html) in 274.

## Background
Prior to first contact, Terrans develop [tachyon communicators](Tachyon_Communicator.html),
allowing faster-than-light communications by sending particles through
[hyperspace](Hyperspace.html). On 2 June 205, Terrans intercepted an unknown communication which
would later prove to be of Ikamo origin; Subsequent communications were intercepted on 2 June 220
and then again on 7 September 226. Analysis of the signal confirmed it was of artificial origin,
and the source was pinpointed to be [Koa](Koa.html).

In the following year of 227, the [First Contact Tone](First_Contact_Tone.html) was relayed to the
Koa system.

## Early exchange
Both sides immediately recognised that mathematical concepts and physical constants should be the
simplest to find common ground on with the tachyon system. Constants such as the pi ratio could be
used to prove ability in maths, however did not provide much insight into the culture, society, or
thoughts of either side beyond acting as a simple intelligence test.

### Binary imaging
A breakthrough came on 11 February 227, where the Ikamo side broadcasted a series of short
transmissions depicting a series of binary "images", with long intervals every set number of bits.
Terran interpretors could form rows of pixels, with longer intervals denoting new lines, and thus
form basic binary images from signals being sent, as well as send images of their own back.

### Natural language
With the ability to now exchange visual information, it was now possible to teach the other their
own natural language. The Ikamo and Terrans exchanged vocabulary, simple sentences, and grammar for
Ikamo [Akhui](Akhui.html) and Terran [English](English.html). Linguists on either side helped decode
and translate the language of the other party.

Upon more complicated sentence structures being translatable, better forms of communication could
be divised, such as colour images and eventually video.

### Hyperdrive joint research project
Prior to contact with the Ikamo, the cause of lost tachyon communications was still unknown to the
Terrans. After natural language communication matured, Ikamo scientists shared research that
theorised that [antimatter](Antimatter.html) was present in large quantities in hyperspace. The
Ikamo lacked the industrial capacity of the then-capitalist Terrans to carry out large scale
practical testing of a proposed [quantum drive](Quantum_Drive.html), a device that could enable
transport through hyperspace. A mutual science deal was agreed upon in 258.

In 274, the project was completed upon the construction of Gateway Prime, a full-scale hyperspace
vehicle that travelled faster than existing [warp drive](Warp_Drive.html) technology. That same
year, Terrans made first physical contact with the Ikamo aboard the ship.

## Legacy
Peaceful contact and first exchange cemented allegience between the Ikamo and Terrans, even through
the following [Solstice War](Solstice_War.html). The two nations often work tightly together on
major public projects, mostly scientific in nature.
