The **Tasune Kadote** (previously known as the **Triton Kadote**) is a infantry automatic [railgun](railgun)
designed by the [Tasune](Tasune) co-op.

The Kadote was developed as a competitor during the [Terran Shock Army](Terran_Shock_Army)'s competition

[Type 230](Type_230). The Kadote would later be adopted by the [Terran Militia](Terran_Militia) as
well.

and polymer materials. The rifle has a removable polymer covering that can be swapped
