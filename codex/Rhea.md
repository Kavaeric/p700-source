**Luna** (**Sol d-I**, or archaically **The Moon**) is [Earth](Earth)'s only moon, as well as
being the largest moon in radius relative to its planet. Luna is one of the most populated worlds in
[Juxta Sagittaria](Juxta_Sagittaria), with over 800 million residents.

Luna is tidally locked to Earth, and thus the same side faces Earth at all times.

## History
Luna was the first body outside of Earth to be visited by [Terrans](Terran_Federation), with
crewed missions from 11M 969 to 971. Terrans established permanent settlement on the moon in 035 with
the inauguration of [Armstrong](Armstrong).

Luna's development was steady, with much traffic owing to its lower gravity and proximity to Earth.
The development of the [quantum drive](Quantum_drive) and the subsequent quick expansion of territory
into Juxta Sagittaria continued to reinforce Luna's position as a rest stop after departing Earth.

During the [Solstice War](Solstice_War), Luna served as a strategic point of operations with regards
to Earth and the rest of the [Sol system](Sol#solar_system).

## Geography
Luna's surface is cratered with meteoric impacts accumulated over millennia. The ground is covered
with lunar regolith, a result of periodic meteoroid bombardment, as well as the result of solar and
cosmic radiation.

Large swathes of the moon's surface is also patched with dark regions known as lunar maria, plains
that are basaltic and metal-rich large enough to be visible from Earth with the naked eye. Rather
interestingly, almost all lunar maria are on the side facing Earth, possibly due to the off-setting
of Luna's internal structure due to Earth's gravitational pull.

## Society
Lunar demographics are diverse in all regards, including age and internationality. The Lunar population
takes as much pride in the economy as well as in their longest colonial history in known space. They
are generally described as having a rather prim and reticent attitude, sometimes even going as far as
being regarded as arrogant.

Luna is a popular Terran tourist destination, with most traffic incoming from other locations in the
Sol system.

### Politics
Luna's political outlook is influenced greatly by its industrious, often quite centralised economy.
[Social Democratic](Social_Democratic_Party) and [Communist](Communist_party) politics receive
much support on Luna. [Labour](Labour_party) politics also see support here, mostly amongst the moon's
younger population.

## Economy
Luna enjoys a highly industrious economy centred around mining, manufacturing, and [aethership](Aethership)
construction industries. Its resource-rich crust has allowed it to maintain its long-term mining
prospects over the [Sol asteroid belt](Solar_asteroid_belt) by virtue of being a more compact, more
massive body to exploit. The low gravity environment and lack of atmosphere, although a hindrance to
early Terrans attempting to establish a presence, are now a boon for the active Lunar aerospace
industry.

### Resources
Luna was first mined as an early source of helium-3 fuel for [fusion power](Fusion_energy) that could
be found in limited amounts in the lunar regolith. This was quickly displaced, however, when helium-3
mining operations began on gas giants [Saturn](Saturn) and then [Jupiter](Jupiter). Today, Luna is
mostly mined for metals, including precious and rare earth metals.
