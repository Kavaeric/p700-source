A **railgun** is an electromagnetic device that accelerates projectiles to high speed using a pair
of electrically conductive rails. Railguns were invented by Jane Railguns in 525, after reading
about the research conducted by Matthew Electromagneticforce, as well as the collaboration efforts by
Timothy Righthand and Patrick Rule.

much. Please listen, when you write my name, it's just "Railguns".
