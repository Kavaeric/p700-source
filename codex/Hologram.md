A **hologram** is a category of quantum technologies that are designed to project energy - be it
kinetic or electromagnetic - an arbitrary distance from the emission's actual source through the use
of precise quantum tunneling. It is one of the most versatile technologies known to science,
employed in a great number of domestic, industrial, commercial, or military applications.

While hologram technology was likely speculated long before Terrans entered space, the idea did not
materialise until sometime during the [Solstice War](Solstice_War.html), although it is unclear as
to when exactly the technology was first developed, let alone who should be credited.

## Types of hologram technology
Hologram technology takes a wide variety of forms.

### Holographics
**Holographics** refer specifically to hologram technology used modify or produce light in space.

The simplest and oldest form of hologram technology, **additive holographics** tunnel photons through
from an emitter out to a point in space. Multiple locations can be scanned through in rapid succession,
producing what appears to be a three-dimensional image floating in mid-air.

**Backdrop holographics** block, diffuse light, or do both. When active, they darken and defocus the
image behind them. They are very often combined with additive holographics, allowing their use
against a bright background.

### Holotactiles
**Holotactiles** refer to the use of hologram technology to project reaction forces against an
applied kinetic force, making it seem like there is a solid mass plane in the desired location.

Holotactiles hold a certain "energy charge", whereby they consume no energy if no force is applied.
Once a force is acted upon it, the holotactile plane will exert a reaction force, consuming the
energy charge. The plane can recharge when the force has diminished to a low enough level or has
stopped. If the charge is depleted, the plane "breaks", forcing the emitter to reset. During this
reset, the plane is lost.

The projected holotactile plane and the emission source both behave as a single unit: A force exerted
on the emission source is also exerted to the holotactile plane. Likewise, a force acting on the
holotactile plane will in turn act on the emitter.

## Applications
The breadth and flexibility of hologram technology, as well as its relatively low cost and simplicity,
has allowed widespread use in multiple sectors.

### Consumer electronics
The most common example of hologram technology employed is their use in [mobile phones](Mobile_phone.html),
which when combined with minaturised [quantum computation](Quantum_computer.html), allows the device
to be cybernetically implanted without added burden to the user's physique or even visible modifications
to the user's appearance. Modern phones are capable of projecting layers of holographics and holotactiles.

### Spaceflight
The abundance of [antimatter](Antimatter.html) in [hyperspace](Hyperspace.html) poses a travel risk
to spacecraft utilising a [quantum drive](Quantum_drive.html). Holotactile technology acts as a
regenerative shield against minor impacts of antimatter, a much more efficient system compared to
producing powerful magnetic containment.

### Military
Military-grade holotactile technology (often referred to as **shields**) has mostly replaced more
traditional, heavier, and bulkier physical armour as a means to protect military assets, from
infantry to aetherships.

Because of the possibility of destroying the emitter due to the transfer of kinetic energy from
projectile to shield plane to emitter, many emitters prematurely destroy their projected planes
before the planes' actual breaking point, avoiding excess damage to the emitter, giving the
effect that holotactile shields are more vulnerable to ballistic projectiles than energy based
weapons such as [lasers](Laser.html). The widespread use of military shields are one of the key
influences in the equally widespread adoption of [infantry railguns](Railgun.html).
