A **warp drive** is a device that permits [faster-than-light travel](Faster-than-light_travel.html).
Warp drives allow equipped space vehicles to effectively "bend" or "warp" spacetime to facilitate
travel. By contracting spacetime in front of a vehicle while simultaneously expanding it behind, the
vehicle may effectively move forward. During this, within the frame of reference of the vehicle and
the space around it, the vehicle is not actually exceeding the speed of light, thereby not contravening
relativistic physics, allowing the vehicle to travel as fast as the hardware may allow it.

## Advantages
As warp drive are a much older technology than [quantum drives](Quantum_drive.html), they tend to be
more cost-effective, although the extent of this can be somewhat limited. They may also be more
energy efficient to run, especially for shorter distances, such as within a star system.

One notable advantage is their relative simplicity to run: While quantum drive use requires careful
coordination and plotting of a flight path through [hyperspace](Hyperspace.html), a warp drive can
simply travel through nominal space with relatively little effort from the side of a crew or computer
system. A warp drive can also be run at sublight speed, expanding its flexibility even more.

### Limitations
The primary limitation of warp drives is the reduced speed. Although a warp drive can theoretically
reach any speed, current technology only barely allows speeds of up to 1000c, and even then with
much inefficiency. A quantum drive, although bulkier, will be able to travel orders of magnitude
faster.

## Applications
The primary application of warp drives is to facilitate transportation within a star system and, to
a lesser extent, within a cluster of tightly grouped stars. Warp drives are also employed heavily
when [hyperspace surveying](Hyperspace.html#hyperspace-surveying), as it allows surveyor ships to
travel uncharted space without running risk of destroying themselves in hyperspace.
