**Jupiter** (**Sol f**, or **Sol-V**) is a gas giant of [Sol](Sol) and the largest planet in its
system. The planet is notable for its huge host of moons, tallying up well over 100, and is sometimes
regarded as a mini-system within the [Sol system](Solar_system).

## History
The colonisation of the outer planets of the Sol system was not a readily realistic prospect for 
[Terrans](Terran_Federation) until the development of faster propulsion methods. In the early 100s
century, [warp travel](Warp_drive) became a viable method of travelling longer distances in greatly
reduced time spans, eliminating much of the time cost that came with early space travel, and the
difficulties associated with it.

Early surveys of Jupiter's Galilean (major) moons revealed that three of them - [Europa](Europa),
[Ganymede](Ganymede), and [Callisto](Callisto) - were likely to host a liquid water ocean underneath
thick solid ice sheets. It was speculated that the oceans of Jupiter's moons could harbour microbial
life. Future visits proved [Europa](Europa) indeed hosts microbial life, although the other moons
were found to be sterile.

Jupiter's moon, Callisto, was settled in 111, with limited mining and research activity.
With the warp drive soon maturing to allow convenient travel between even the furthest points within
the Sol system, its deep gravity well when compared to the other gas and ice giants in the Sol system,
and its lethal radiation, Jupiter has seen relatively limited development on its moons, let alone
in the atmosphere of the gas giant itself.

## Habitation and economy
While the largest source of fuels such as hydrogen and helium-3 in the Solar system, the gravity well
of Jupiter makes it more difficult to mine than neighbouring planets [Saturn](Saturn) or [Uranus](Uranus).

The vast majority of activity around Jupiter is concentrated on Callisto, the outermost of Jupiter's
four Galilean moons, with more sparse development on Ganymede, Europa, and Io, and its other
smaller moons. The bulk of the Jovian economy is the export of water, mined from the moons' vast
amounts of water ice as well as drawn directly from the huge liquid oceans lying beneath three of
the four moons' surface ice sheets, which is subsequently exported elsewhere within and without the
Sol system.
