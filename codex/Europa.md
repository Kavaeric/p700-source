**Europa** is the second of the Galilean moons of [Jupiter](Jupiter), and like the others, it is
tidally locked to Jupiter. Alongside [Ganymede](Ganymede) and [Callisto](Callisto), Europa has an
extensive saline ocean underneath a thick layer of surface ice.

Europa is most famous for being the only other location in the [Sol system](Solar_system) to harbour
native life, other than [Earth](Earth) itself. Because of this, the [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation)
heavily restricts any kind of development on Europa, only allowing ventures to the moon to be done
on a scientific basis, with some leniency given for accompanying relatives or friends.
