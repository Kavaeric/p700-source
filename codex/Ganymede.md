**Ganymede** is one of the Galilean (major) moons of [Jupiter](Jupiter). It is the largest moon in the
[Sol system](Solar_system), with a diameter exceeding that of planet [Mercury](Mercury), although much
less dense due to its substantial water ice content in its composition. Ganymede is tidally locked
to Jupiter.

Although larger and more massive than [Luna](Luna), Ganymede's lower density results in a slightly
lower surface gravity than that of Luna. It is also well within Jupiter's radiation belts, and for
these reasons, [Callisto](Callisto) tends to be favoured over it.

## Geography
Like its neighbouring moons Callisto and [Europa](Europa), Ganymede has a liquid saline ocean underneath
a thick layer of ice hundreds of kilometres thick. Ganymede's ocean contains more water than any other
body in the Sol system, including [Earth](Earth), with depths reaching over 100 kilometres deep.

## Society and economy
Much of Ganymede's population live in shielded habitats or in settlements buried deep inside the
moon's icy crust in order to avoid the bulk of Jupiter's radiation. Its colonies focus much on the
export of water, and occasionally on the mining and sifting of light elements in its icy crust,
or through aquaculture through the pocket terraforming of its ocean.

The Ganymede population mostly resides in its largest settlement, Packard, however the colony is
rather spread out itself. Ganymedians often support the [Labour Party](Labour_Party).
