**Hyperspace** (or **superdimensional space**) refers to a parallel plane of existence alongside
nominal three-dimensional space, but with eleven spatial dimensions instead.

## Effects on nominal space
Hyperspace was first theorised as a possible explanation for the general weakness of gravity.
Compared to the other three of the four elementary forces (strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and
electromagnetic), gravity appears to be some 10<sup>37</sup> times weaker in nominal space, however
it was theorised that the strength of gravity was trapped within one or more of the dimensions that
is not one of the dimensions in nominal space.

As an analogy, a cube is a three-dimensional object with all edges being of equal length. The cube
can be projected into two-dimensional space as well, like its shadow being casted against a flat
wall. If the cube is angled in a particular way, the projection may give the impression that some of
the cube's sides are shorter than the others. The cube in this analogy refers to superdimensional
space, projecting itself into nominal three-dimensional space and thus also distorting the true
strength of gravity.

### Antimatter and dark matter
A similar theory was also proposed to explain baryon asymmetry, that being why there is so much more
matter in the universe than [antimatter](Antimatter.html). It was suggested in this theory that
antimatter was in fact created in equal parts, but with the extra energy endowed during the big
bang, slipped into hyperspace and became trapped.

The two theories were combined to result in general hyperspace theory, where both antimatter and
gravity became trapped within hyperspace. Antimatter in particular would continue to exert a
gravitational pull in nominal space, as dark matter.

In a process called [antimatter trawling](Antimatter_trawling.html), antimatter can be collected
from hyperspace and brought back into nominal space to be used as an energy source.

## Hyperspace surveying

As hyperspace exists parallel to nominal space, it can be mapped, with points in hyperspace matched
to points in nominal space, allowing for the charting of viable routes between systems.

Antimatter in hyperspace can also be mapped. By sending particles on short journeys through
hyperspace, a receiver can record which particles made it through. Any ones that didn't are assumed
to have been annihilated from coming into contact with antimatter, and a map of antimatter in
hyperspace can be built.
