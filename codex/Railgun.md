A **railgun** is an electromagnetic device that accelerates projectiles with electrical current
induced by two conducting rails. While finding many applications, the term is often used to refer
exclusively the weaponised variety.

## Theory
A railgun is constructed with a pair of electrically conducting rails. An armature containing the
projectile is placed between them. On activation, current flows from one rail through the armature
and back down the other, completing a full circuit. The two rails produce a magnetic field that
"spin" in opposite directions, causing a net magnetic field directed vertically up or down. With
electrical current flowing across from one rail to the other through the armature, this produces
a force, called the Lorentz Force, perpendicular to both the heightwise magnetic field and the
widthwise electrical current, sending the armature (and projectile) lengthwise out of the armature.

## Development
Terran railgun weapons technology was being developed as early as the 000s century, promising to
deliver higher firepower and projectile speed than conventional chemical-propelled ballistic
weapons. [Metallurgy](Metallurgy.html) at the time, however, had not yet advanced far enough to make
the technology practical even for heavy artillery. Thus, the rails of early prototypes would
destroy themselves from the heat and electrical current, needing to be repaired or outright
replaced after every shot.

Railguns were considered for the deployment of atmospheric aerosols during the
[Terran climate change](Terran_Climate_Change.html) period of the 000s and 100s centuries, but was
scrapped in favour of dispersal from aircraft.

## Dual-stage railgun
The dual-stage railgun (DSR) is the most common form of weaponised railgun in service today. The
mechanism allows rugged and reliable operation of the railgun mechanism, as well as a solution for
reliability issues caused by friction between rails and a solid armature.

### Core
Railgun ammunition is known as **railgun cores**, although referring them to as **railgun rounds**
is commonplace as well. They are composed of two primary layers:

* An ablative layer that will turn into plasma upon contact with the rail. The plasma will
act as an armature connecting the rails to the projectile.
* The actual projectile that will be delivered to the target. Projectiles are made of alloys
designed to conduct electricity but not heat. Specialist rounds using different materials are
also commonplace, as are entirely different constructions, such as sabots.

### Rails
The weapon rails are divided into two main stages. The first stage known as the **primer rail**
is a short segment in which the round is given a relatively low velocity. An electrical current is
initially induced through direct contact with the rails. The outer ablative layer of the round is
turned into a highly conductive plasma.

After the primer rail, the round enters the second stage **power rail**. The now-exposed projectile
does not actually make direct contact with the rails in the power stage, instead, the plasma created
acts as an armature bridging the circuit between the rails and the projectile. Here the projectile
is accelerated to full speed. The current flowing through the projectile causes it to melt before
exiting through the railgun aperture. A fired, melted railgun projectile that has exited the railgun
is commonly referred to as a "bolt".

As the projectile is molten on firing, power rails on most modern railgun designs incorporate
ability to shape the moving projectile as it passes through. Typically, an exiting projectile
will be extruded into a very elongated needle shape, optimised to both deliver best aerodynamic
performance, piercing ability, and also suppression of the bolt's sonic boom.

It is common to tint bolts with various colours. Either through direct doping of the core or, less
commonly, through injection to the rails, certain compounds can give rise to various shades of hue
in the bolt. Certain compounds can be use, such as copper or calcium for blue and orange
respectively, or through the use of [quantum dots](Quantum_Dots.html).
