The **Anthropocene calendar** is the predominant calendar system used by the
[Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html). It is heavily based off of the older Gregorian
calendar, with its only difference being its definition of year zero as the beggining of Terran
agriculture.

The anthropocene calendar uses years roughly equivalent to the orbital period of [Earth](Earth.html)
around [Sol](Sol.html). Each year is divided into 12 months of alternating 30 to 31 days, with
the second month - February - being 28 days long, resulting in a typical year lasting 365 Earth days.
Because an actual Earth orbit lasts for 365.2422 days, however, the calendar designates certain
years as leap years. These leap years include a 29-day long February to make up for the time gap.

## Date formatting

In general, when writing the date, Terrans order the units of time in descending order, that is from
the largest unit (usually millennium or year) to the smallest, either with the millennium-year system,
or with the absolute year. A full date can be written as such:

> 12M 717 January 2<br>
> 12,717 January 2

The day of the week can also be specified, appended to the end:

> 12M 717 January 2, Tuesday

Often, the millennium is left out due to being redundant, in which the date will simply start with
the millennium year:

> 717 January 2

The date can also be formatted with only numbers, with the millennium-year system replaced with the
absolute year:

> 12717-01-02

## Spoken and written

The date **12M 717 January 2** can be written or spoken out in full as:

> Millennium twelve, year seven hundred seventeen, January second<br>
> Millennium twelve, year seven-seventeen, January second 

When the millennium is omitted, there is often no need to say "year" when referring to the millennium
year:

> Seven hundred seventeen, January second<br>
> Seven-seventeen, January second
