**Saturn** (**Sol g**, or **Sol-VI**) is a gas giant of [Sol](Sol) and the second largest planet in
its system, famous for its striking and photogenic ring structure as well as lively local community.
Saturn is an economically and strategically important [Terran](Terran_Federation) hub world in the
Sol system, home to over 1 billion inhabitants, second only to [Earth](Earth).

## History
The first crewed [Terran](Terran) missions began in the late 000s century. Huygens base was established
in 091, some 25 years after the Terran presence was established around [Jupiter](Jupiter), owing much
to the vast distances found in the outer [Solar system](Solar_system). The then new [warp drive](Warp_drive)
was key to the exploration of distant bodies such as Saturn.

Development was limited, however, until after the [First Exchange](First_Exchange), where the new
[antimatter](antimatter) economy could justify continued expansion of settlements on Saturn's moons.
With a greater energy budget than ever, proposals were even introduced to terraform some of the moons
in their entirety.

The [Solstice War](Solstice_War), however, largely put those plans and development on hold. During
the war, Saturn, alongside [Uranus](Uranus), was a hotly contested strategic point, given by its
location within the Sol system, as well as its viability as a strategic supply depot, especially
for fuel.

After the conclusion of the war and the formation of the [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation),
development resumed at an accelerated pace around Saturn as a mining hub for light metals, water, and
fuels from the gas giant's atmosphere. Proposals to terraform the moons were revived, although mostly
scaled back.

In 611, a [Nesse Piano](Nesse_Piano_Mystery) was found on [Rhea](Rhea).

## Habitation
A number of moons around Saturn have been partially terraformed, namely portions of [Rhea](Rhea),
portions of [Dione](Dione), as well as portions of [Tethys](Tethys). These pockets of terraforming
are achieved by sectioning portions of the moon into airtight regions with transparent roofs, then
importing air, water, and vegetation to achieve an [Earthlike](Earth) environment.

The terraforming of [Titan](Titan) was proposed prior to the Solstice War, but never came to fruition
as Titan's computation-based economy relies heavily on the planet's dense atmosphere and frigid
temperatures. Among other moons, notably [Enceladus](Enceladus), settlements using more traditional
means, with airtight or underground habitats.

## Society
Saturnians are diverse, as per Terran usual on more populous worlds, as well as being rather outspoken,
friendly, and lively, sometimes to the point of aloofness. The nightlife is a popular staple in
Saturnian society. Saturnian government is highly formal and stratified, adhering to a very federalist
model of government.

Saturnian politics are equally as diverse as its population, but generally favour those of the
[Social Democratic Party](Social_Democratic_Party), as well as more scattered support for more Anarchist
alignments such as the [Anarchist](Anarchist_Party) or [Social Market](Social_Market_Party) parties.

## Economy
Saturn's economy is primarily based on mining its atmosphere for fuels like hydrogen, and helium-3,
as well as a number of other gases including helium-3 and methane. Atmospheric mining is done on board
aerostat installations within Saturn's atmosphere, that passively collect gases and refine them using
onboard facilities. These facilities are often powered by networks of wind turbines, situated deeper
in the Saturnian atmosphere. Transport shuttles continuously ferry material and passengers from these
stations into orbit, which can then be exported elsewhere.

Saturn's moons enjoy a lucrative industrial economy. The non-terraformed portions of Saturn's moons,
as well as their low gravity, allow for high-output industries as well as extensive [aethership](Aethership)
businesses. Enceladus' water export economy is also taken advantage of, giving the habitation of the
moons an edge in terms of affordability.

Saturn's picturesque ring system is the subject of much of Terran's art. The terraformed portions of
the moons grant tourists the view of the rings, while requiring little in the way of spacesuits or
environmental protection. The lively Saturnian community also contributes to boost the planet's
popularity as a tourist destination.
