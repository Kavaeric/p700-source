A **ranger** is a person specially trained to operate in extremely isolated locations for extended periods of time, including operating in hazardous environments. Rangers are members of the 
[Ranger Union](Ranger_Union.html), an agency of the [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html).

Rangers always work in pairs. A ranger unit is comprised of two rangers:

* The **aeranger**, an [aerosynth](Aerosynth.html) who can better travel long distances;
* The **teranger**, a biped, who can better navigate in smaller scales, such as on the surface of
a planet or in a structure.
