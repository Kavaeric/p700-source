**Mercury** (**Sol b**, or **Sol-I**) is the closest orbiting body to [Sol](Sol.html), as well as
the smaller planet in its system. Its lack of atmosphere, slow rotation speed, and proximity to its
star results in a hostile temperature range: Its dark side can drop to a frigid 80K, while its light
side scorched to a blistering 700K.

## History
Mercury was colonised in 073, with a research outpost built underneath the surface on its north pole
as a way to escape the bulk of the incoming solar radiation as well as the resulting temperatures.
During this time, pre-spaceflight [Terran governments](Terran_Federation.html) considered the possibility
of devoting Mercury to solar power collection, with the resulting energy either being beamed to [Earth](Earth.html)
by way of laser relay, or by manufacturing [antimatter fuel](Antimatter.html). The planet's proximity
to Sol and its harsh temperatures, however, kept this idea from reality.

After the discovery and proliferation of [warp technology](Warp_drive.html) in the late 000s and early
100s centuries, the colonisation of Mercury was up for reconsideration, this time with an emphasis
on mining the planet for its material wealth. Over the course of decades, its polar research stations
were slowly transformed into industrial mining facilities, exploiting the plentiful solar power as
a means of reducing costs, a strategy prominently hailed as making Mercury more desirable to mine
than the [Solar asteroid belt](Solar_asteroid_belt.html).

In the past several decades, a number of individuals and groups have proposed a long-term project of
disassembling Mercury and using its materials to construct a Dyson swarm around Sol. It, however,
has gained sparse popularity, as few find the gains of a Solar Dyson swarm advantageous enough,
especially in light of the [antimatter](Antimatter.html) economy. Not unexpectedly, this proposal is
even less popular amongst the current inhabitants of Mercury.

## Society and economy 
At present, Mercury continues to be mined extensively as well as serving as a technological research
centre. Its extreme environment has been turned into a blessing as numerous Earth-based companies and
agencies flock to it for research and testing purposes, while the minimal cost of electricity gives
ease to those performing energy-intense research.

Mercurians typically lean towards the [Social Democratic party](Social_Democratic_Party), though there
is considerable support for [New Federalist](New_Federalist_Party) politics as well.

## Geography
The surface of Mercury is barren and was heavily cratered over millions of years due to its lack
of atmosphere. The planet's composition is roughly 70% metallic, resulting in a dense planet with
a surface gravity similar to that of [Mars](Mars.html) despite being less than three-quarters the
diameter.
