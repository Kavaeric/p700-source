The **Wintertide Accord** is an elite element of the [Terran](Terran_Federation) [military](Terran_Military).
Wintertide operatives are organised into independent cells; the number of cells remains unknown.

The Wintertide Accord has roots during the [Solstice War](Solstice_War), as the agreement meant to
stem sectarian infighting and ally the various revolutionary forces against the [Terran Union](Terran_Union).
