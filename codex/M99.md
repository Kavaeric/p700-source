The **M99** is a [railgun](Railgun) pistol seen in widespread service within [Terran](Terran_Federation)
space. The M99 is of mixed polymer and alloy construction, and is known for its compact size, as well
as easily obtainable open-source schematics, although its demand for higher-performance materials leave
a barrier up for most. The pistol is sometimes referred to as the "little sibling" of the similarly
designed [M87](M87).

The M99 sees common service, often attributed to the pistol's relative lightweight build and
simplicity of manufacture, as well as ease of maintenance, although its open-source nature means
quality of construction may vary wildly depending on manufacturer and supplier.

## Mystery of origin
Most bizzare in this weapon's reputation is its unattributed nature: The original designer of the
weapon is unknown. More historic copies of the weapon schematics refer to a designer by the name of
Addiesue Vonnie, and although they are commonly cited as the weapon's original designer, attempts to
validate the identity of such a person have turned up empty-handed.
